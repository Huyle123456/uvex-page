    description: `Testing system for perfectly fitting hearing protectors
uvex xact-fit delivers an efficient and highly user-friendly fit-testing system that helps you understand exactly how much protection you're receiving from your hearing protectors, regardless of brand or model. This innovative and extremely lightweight kit includes Bluetooth headphones and a tablet for a cordless and quick set-up, as well as a carrying case, allowing the set to be used anywhere. The pre-installed software and cloud storage offer an increased level of security. You can automatically upload results onto the tablet and share these with other devices. Fit-testing workers for proper hearing protection has never been so easy. This is how the uvex xact-fit testing system works: using the Real Ear Attenuation at Threshold (REAT), users undergo a series of tests where they must determine their Hearing Threshold score, both with and without hearing protection. This is the lowest volume at which a sound can be detected, and it is different for every person. This measuring process is used to determine the personal protection factor (Personal Attenuation Rating, PAR), which tells you how much protection you're receiving from your hearing protectors as a result of the fit.`,

    productName: "uvex aXess one",
    description: `uvex aXess one - active Bluetooth earmuffs — safe. active. connected.
uvex aXess one are active Bluetooth earmuffs with RAL (real active listening) function. Users can still hear ambient noise despite wearing hearing protection, so they can still communicate with others and react effectively to warning signals. The volume of the ambient noise can be adjusted to suit individual needs, as the integrated sound level limiter protects the hearing from impulse sounds. The Bluetooth 5.0 connection can be used to connect to a telephone or radio, so users can communicate with others without interrupting work. The dual connection mode enables two devices to be connected at the same time. The functions can be operated quickly and easily using the function keys on the earmuffs — and both hands remain free for work. The audio assistant provides the latest status updates, so there is no need to remove the earmuffs in hazardous areas. When not in use, uvex aXess one can be stored easily without taking up much space thanks to the foldable headband. Another storage option is our earmuff bag with belt loops, article no. 2000002
